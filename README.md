CODSOFT - Web Development<br>
Task 1 - Landing Page<br>
Features Used:-<br>
◼️HTML<br>
◼️CSS<br><br>
A landing page is crucial for any online service as it serves as the first impression for potential customers, providing them with essential information and encouraging them to engage with the service further.<br>
I created a landing page as part of my internship project. The landing page is designed for a wheel repair service, and I used HTML and CSS to build it.<br>
In the landing page, visitors can likely find information about the wheel repair services offered, along with details about the company providing the service. The use of HTML indicates the structuring of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, and images, while CSS would be used for styling and layout, ensuring the page looks visually appealing and user-friendly.<br><hr>
